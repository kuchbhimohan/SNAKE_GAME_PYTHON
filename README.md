# SNAKE_GAME_PYTHON

Snake Game

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to control the snake using arrow keys and guide it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game window and the snake's own body. 

Key Features:
- Implemented core game mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.
- Utilized the Turtle graphics library to render the game window and objects, providing a visually engaging experience.
- Incorporated user input handling for responsive snake control using arrow keys.
- Kept track of the player's score, which increases as the snake eats food.
- Implemented game over conditions when the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.

To run the game, ensure Python and the Turtle graphics library are installed. Simply execute the Python script and enjoy playing the Snake game!
